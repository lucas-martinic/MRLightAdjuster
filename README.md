![MRLA](https://github.com/lucas-martinic/MRLightAdjuster/assets/42948357/3e30e2a9-434f-4c27-87b3-d939d188814e)

## What is MRLA?

A drag-and-drop solution for better and faster mixed reality light adjustment, especially when recording video footage in different light conditions with the same app.

## Get Started

You can either clone the repository, which contains the same scene used to record the video, or you can directly download the .unitypackage here: https://github.com/lucas-martinic/MRLightAdjuster/blob/main/Assets/MRLightAdjuster/MRLightAdjuster.unitypackage

You will find a LightAdjuster prefab that you can drag and drop in your scene.

Scene requirements:
- URP
- Directional Light
- OVRCameraRig with HandGrab interactions.

If the requirements are met, the prefab will automatically assign the required references.

## Have fun!
